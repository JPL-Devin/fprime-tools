class Build:
    """Represents a build configuration

    Builds in F´ consist of a build type (normal, testing), a cmake project directory, a set of settings, and a target
    platform. These are tracked as part of this Build class. This helps setup a build cache directory, load default
    settings, and track what type of build is being run.

    BuildType represents the type of build as explained in that enum type.
    Projects are an individual build of fprime, and should define the CMakeLists.txt file as a child of this
    directory. A default settings.ini file may be found here.
    Platforms represent the target hardware to build from. This is translated to the CMake toolchain file.

    After creation, a user must use invent to handle new builds (e.g. during the generation step), or load to load a
    previously generated build.

    Examples:
        To use in generation run the following code.

        build = Build(BuildType.BUILD_NORMAL, path/to/project)
        build.invent("raspberrypi")

        To use at any step after generation:

        build = Build(BuildType.BUILD_NORMAL, path/to/project)
